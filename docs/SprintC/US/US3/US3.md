# US3 - To register a new client

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description

As a receptionist of the laboratory, I want to register a client.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**

- "In case of a new client, the **receptionist registers the client in the application**. To register a client the receptionist needs the client’s citizen card number, National Healthcare Service (NHS) number, birth date, sex, Tax Identification number (TIN), phone number, email and name."
- "Once the laboratory coordinator confirms that everything was done correctly the client receives a notification alerting that the results are already available in the central application and informing that **he/she must access the application** to view those results."
- "All those who wish to use the application must be **authenticated with a password** holding seven alphanumeric characters, including three capital letters and two digits."

**From the client clarifications:**

> - **Question:**- Considering the creation of new clients, we have this information. - "To register a client the receptionist needs the client’s citizen card number, National Healthcare Service (NHS) number, birth date, sex, Tax Identification number (TIF), phone number, e-mail and name."- Which type/format they should have? - Citizen Card/NHS/TIF - which length - Birthday - in which format? - Sex - should only be Male/Female or include more options. - Phone number: which length/format? - Also, are all the fields required/mandatory?
>- **Answer:**- "Citizen Card": 16 digit number- "NHS": 10 digit number- "TIN": 10 digit number- "Birth day - in which format?": DD/MM/YY- "Sex - should only be Male/Female or include more options:" Male/Female- "Phone number: which length/format?:" 11 digit number- The phone number is opcional. All other fields are required.

<br/>


>- **Question:** What are exactly the **optional attributes** when creating a client? In a previous post you've stated that it was only the phone number, and in another that it was only the sex.
>- **Answer:** The **sex** is opcional. All other fields are required.

<br/>

>- **Question:** Recently you said that the maximum acceptable **age** is 150 years old, so the client can be born in 1870 and the data format is DD/MM/YY, this format can be tricky because, for example, if the data is DD/MM/70 the data can indicate that he born on 1870 or 1970. How can we solve this? Or I am understanding wrong?
>- **Answer:** Thank you for identifying this issue. Please consider DD / MM / YYYY format for all dates.

<br/>


>- **Question:** Is there any restrictions to the client **age**?
>- **Answer:** A client should not have more than 150 years of age. Although there are important developments in the pursuit of eternal youth, for now this value is ok.

<br/>


>- **Question:** login information?
>- **Answer:**  e-mail and password   
   

<br/>

>- **Question:** Also, regarding the acronym **TIF**, and for Glossary and consistency purposes, there seems to be a misleading information. All the aforementioned resources refer to the Taxpayer Identification Number as TIN, and not TIF, as stated in the Integrative Project Descritption. Which version of the acronym do you want us to use in the software?
>- **Answer:** It was a typo. I wanted to write TIN.

<br/>


>- **Question:** What should be the maximum length of the String with the **name** of the Client?
>- **Answer:** A string with no more than 35 characters.

<br/>


>- **Question:** Can they change their **password** whenever they want?
>- **Answer:** No. For now, there are no user story or use case to update the password.

<br/>


>- **Question:** What parameter (asked by the receptionist) should the system use to create the **password** of the new client?
>- **Answer:** The password should be randomly generated. It should have ten alphanumeric characters.

<br/>


>- **Question:** Should each client have an unique **ID**, generated during their creation?
>- **Answer:** No.

<br/>


>- **Question:**  Also, does the **phone number** has to be validated as a valid phone number? And can it be registered with a prefix (+44) or just the number?
>- **Answer:** This lab only operates in England, there is no need to use the prefix.

<br/>


>- **Question:** Should some data of the client (**phone number** and **e-mail** address, for example) be edited in the future?
>- **Answer:** For now there is no need to have such feature.

<br/>


>- **Question:** During the registration of a customer, if he gives a phone number already used by another customer, should the registration continue normally or should it be canceled?
>- **Answer:** From a previous post: "The **e-mail** address and **phone number** should be unique for each user". The system should present a message informing about the error and asking for a different phone number.

<br/>


>- **Question:** "How should the system send a **e-mail** to the client with the password
>- **Answer:** Considering a set of technical restrictions, during the development of the Integrative Project we will not use any e-mail or SMS API services to send messages. All the e-mail and SMS messages should be written to a file with the name emailAndSMSMessages.txt. This file simulates the use of e-mail and SMS API services.

<br/>


>- **Question:** Does the **e-mail** have to be validated as a valid address or do we just accept whatever input the receptionist writes?
>- **Answer:** You should use a regular expression to validate the e-mail address.

<br/>


>- **Question:** After being registered by the receptionist, should the client receive some kind of confirmation e-mail in order to finish his registration?
>- **Answer:** The client only receives an **e-mail** informing that the registration was successful and that he can start to use the system. The e-mail includes the client password.

<br/>


>- **SW Client**: Considering a set of technical restrictions, during the development of the Integrative Project we will not use any **e-mail** or SMS API services to send messages. All the e-mail and SMS messages should be written to a file with the name emailAndSMSMessages.txt. This file simulates the use of e-mail and SMS API services.

<br/>


>- **Question:** "The **client**, after receiving the notification that the results are available in the application, how does he/she access? Does he/she have user access, or does he/she only access the result through a link generated for him/her?"
>- **Answer:** Every client will be registered as a user of the application. This will be a user story in Sprint B. After being registered, the client can access the application at any time.

<br/>

>- **Question:** Relative to registering a new user, how should the system respond in the event of creating a new **user with the same attributes** of an already existing user?
>- **Answer:** This should be treated as an error. A subset of the attributes of any client are unique.

### 2.2. Other Remarks

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  |	... interacting with the actor? | RegisterClientUI   |  **Pure Fabrication:** there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model           |
| 			  		 |	... coordinating the US? | RegisterClientController | **Controller**                             |
| Step 2  |							 |             |                              |
| Step 3  |	...transfer the data typed in the UI to the domain? | ClientDto | **DTO:** When there is so much data to transfer, it is better to opt by using a DTO in order to reduce coupling between UI and domain |
|                        |	...saving the typed data? | Client  | **IE:** a client knows its own data 						 |             |                              |
| 		                 |	... instantiating a new Client? | ClientStore   | **Creator (R1)** and **HC+LC**: By the application of the Creator (R1) it would be the "Company". But, by applying HC + LC to the "Company", this delegates that responsibility to the "ClientStore"   |
|  		 			     |  ... knows ClientStore?	 |  Company   |  **IE:** Company knows the ClientStore to which it is delegating some tasks |
|  		             |	... validating all data (local validation)? | Client | **IE:** an object knows its data|
| 			  		 |	... validating all data (global validation)? | ClientStore | **IE:** knows all the clients| 
|                    | ... validate the exclusivity of the client's email? | AuthFacade | **IE:** user management is responsibility of the respective external component whose point of interaction is through the class "AuthFacade"
| Step 4 |	 |   |  |        
| Step 5 |	... generating the password? | PasswordGenerator | **IE** and **Pure Fabrication:** ClientStore has all the required information and means to generate the password (IE). However, to avoid code duplication (cf. US7) this responsibility might be assign to a common and shared artificial class, specialized in this task.|
| 			  		 |	... registering the client as a system user? | AuthFacade | **IE:** cf. A&A component documentation | 
| 			  		 |	... saving the client? | ClientStore | **IE:** Knows all clients| 
| 			  		 |	... sending email? | EmailNotificationSender | **IE** and **Pure Fabrication:** has all the required information and means to send the email (IE). However, to avoid code duplication (cf. US7) this responsibility might be assign to a common and shared artificial class, specialized in this task.| 
| Step 6  |	... informing operation success?| RegisterClientUI  | **IE:** is responsible for user interactions  | 

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Company
* Client

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

* RegisterClientUI
* RegisterClientController
* ClientStore
* ClientDto
* **PasswordGenerator**
* **EmailNotificationSender**

Other software classes of external systems/components:

* AuthFacade


## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

![US3_SD](US3_SD.svg)

**Remark 1:** It is worth noticing that all objects' interactions are consistent with the responsibilities assigned during the rationale.

**Remark 2:** The **__interaction use__** technique could be used to highlight that details regarding to (i) generate password and (ii) send an email are available on complementary sequence diagrams. The reason for that relies on the fact that such technique was not timely lectured to all classes during sprint B.


![US3_SD_GeneratingPassword](US3_SD_GeneratingPassword.svg)

![US3_SD_SendingEmail](US3_SD_SendingEmail.svg)

**Remark 3:** The most attentive ones might be wondering how the _ClientStore_ knows the _AuthFacade_ object since, according to the depicted SD, the first object is interacting with the second one but nothing is stated about it. To enlight such information an additional SD is provided, presenting a very common approach for objects to get knowing other objects on which they depend on.

# 6. Integration and Demo

* A new option to the receptionist menu was added.

# 7. Observations

As requested by the SW Client the e-mail are not being sent. Instead, email are being written to a file with the name emailAndSMSMessages.txt.

Further, after SW Client deciding which Email Service to use, it will be necessary to update the class __EmailNotificationSender__.
